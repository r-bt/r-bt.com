<Profile title="Baker House – 🛏 Dorms - MIT" />

It's hard to find specific information about the culture here. Seems to be:

- Social
- Sporty (Due to closeness to fields / facilities lots of athletes live here)

Baker has some good pros:

- All rooms have sinks which is super handy
- Really close to student centre and classes
- View of the Charles river

However:

- It's expensive (dining plan and $6,530-$4,560 per semester)
