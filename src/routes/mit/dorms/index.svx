<Profile title="üõè Dorms - MIT" />

**Disclaimer:** I have **no** first-hand experience of MIT dorms. Most MIT
first-years live in one of 11 houses on campus. You pick which dorms you want to
live in, and each have different cultures. This is a (growing) collection of information
I've found while searching for which dorms I want to live in. It's intended to
remind me of what I've found and potentially help other people start researching
dorms. However, don't use this on it's own and try talk to actual students in dorms.

If anything I've written is incorrecct or you have more info feel free to contact me or edit the source at: [r-bt.com Github repo](https://github.com/r-bt/r-bt.com)

- Note [McCormick](https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/map/mccormick-hall) as a female-only dorm is not included

## Factors I'm considering

- [Cook for myself **or** meal plan?](/mit/dorms/cook-for-yourself): **Cook for myself**
- East vs West Campus?
- Do I want a roommate?
- Big dorm or small dorm?
- Unified Culture or Floor culture?
- Do I want a cat in my dorm? **Yes** Don't know why, but cats / dogs always make me smile

## Miscelaneous

Seems like there is a East / West Campus divide in terms of dorm cultures

Uhhh, I can't make decisions anymore (~ Richard after spending two days to only decide I want to cook for myself)
