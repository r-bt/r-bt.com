I'm going through MIT's [18.01 course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/index.htm) on OCW to prep for the 18.01 ASE which I'm hoping to take in August. The content is great but the organisation on the website isn't. I'm currently writing up what I hope is an improved version, but I digress.

In the [Graphing Functions Notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/readings/g_graphng_fnctns.pdf) `even` and `odd` functions are mentioned:

â†’ An even function is one whose graph is **symmetric** with respect to the y-axis:

<SideBySide>
<div slot="left">

$$f(x) = f(-x)$$

</div> 
<img slot="right" srcset={EvenFunction} alt="Even Function" /> 
</SideBySide>

â†’ An odd function is one whose graph is **symmetric** with respect to the origin:

<SideBySide>
<div slot="left">

$$-f(x)=f(-x)$$

</div> 
<img slot="right" srcset={EvenFunction} alt="Even Function" /> 
</SideBySide>

What's neat is that every function $f(x)$ can be written as the sum of an `even` function $e(x)$ and an `odd` function $o(x)$ where:

$e(x) = \frac{1}{2}(f(x)+f(-x))$ **and**

$o(x)=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)-f(-x))$

Now, I only found this out while trying to do the first off the Problem Set questions, which I'll show a solution for below. But first the proof

## Proof

Suppose that the statement was true.

Let $f(x)=e(x)+o(x)$ where **e** is even and **o** is odd

Then:

$f(-x)=e(-x)+o(-x)$

but we know that $e(-x)=e(x)$ **and $o(-x)=-o(x)$** so:

$f(-x)=e(x)-o(x)$

and:

$f(x)+f(-x)=2e(x)$

and so:

$e(x)=\frac{1}{2}(f(x)+f(-x))$

Now, we just have to show that $o(x)=f(x)-e(x)$ is `odd` and we have proved this

$o(x)=f(x)-e(x)=f(x)-\frac{f(x)+f(-x)}{2}=\frac{f(x)-f(-x)}{2}$

and this is an odd function:

$-o(x)=\frac{-f(x)+f(-x)}{2}=\frac{f(-x)-f(x)}{2}$

$o(-x)=\frac{f(-x)-f(x)}{2}$
